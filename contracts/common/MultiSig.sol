/**
 * @title Multisignature wallet - Allows multiple parties to agree on proposals before
 * execution.
 * @author Stefan George - <stefan.george@consensys.net>
 * @dev NOTE: This contract has its limitations and is not viable for every
 * multi-signature setup. On a case by case basis, evaluate whether this is the
 * correct contract for your use case.
 * In particular, this contract doesn't have an atomic "add owners and increase
 * requirement" operation.
 * This can be tricky, for example, in a situation where a MultiSig starts out
 * owned by a single owner. Safely increasing the owner set and requirement at
 * the same time is not trivial. One way to work around this situation is to
 * first add a second address controlled by the original owner, increase the
 * requirement, and then replace the auxillary address with the intended second
 * owner.
 * Again, this is just one example, in general make sure to verify this contract
 * will support your intended usage. The goal of this contract is to offer a
 * simple, minimal multi-signature API that's easy to understand even for novice
 * Solidity users.
 * Forked from
 * github.com/celo-org/celo-monorepo/blob/master/packages/protocol/contracts/common/MultiSig.sol
